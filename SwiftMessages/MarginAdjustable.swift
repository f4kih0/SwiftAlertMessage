/*
 Message views that implement the `MarginAdjustable` protocol will have their
 `layoutMargins` adjusted by SwiftMessages to account for the height of the
 status bar (when displayed under the status bar) and a small amount of
 overshoot in the bounce animation. `MessageView` implements this protocol
 by way of its parent class `BaseView`.
 
 For the effect of this protocol to work, subviews should be pinned to the
 message view's margins and the `layoutMargins` property should not be modified.
 
 This protocol is optional. A message view that doesn't implement `MarginAdjustable`
 is responsible for setting is own internal margins appropriately.
